# What is Rebar?

Rebar is a plug-and-play base framework for the alternative GTA:V multiplayer client alt:V. Rebar is meant to act as a light framework that provides utility, and a basic standard for building plugins that can be compatible with other plugins.

It's a single resource game mode with the best features from the Athena Framework. It has a heavy focus on simplifying building game modes and lowering the friction of building a server.

## Why Rebar?

Rebar is the foundational piece necessary to construct large concrete structures. Think of this framework as achieving the same from a game-mode standpoint.

## What about Athena?

Athena I think has reached a point where I'm no longer interested in providing support for the project. It still works as a decent starting point, but I've added too many features to the point where it lost its way during production. I wanted Athena to be a plugin-based framework, but users kept pushing for more and more.

With that being said, Rebar is an attempt to scavenge the good parts and leave behind the complexities.

## Backward Compatible Plugins?

No. Rebar will have a slightly different API that is similar to Vue Composables.
